## Repository Structure

Here’s a breakdown of the folders included:

| Folder | Description |
|---|---|
| `Basics/` | Fundamental Python exercises (syntax, data types, control flow, functions) |
| `Databases/` | Scripts or code interacting with databases (CRUD operations etc.) |
| `Libraries/` | Use of external/open-source Python libraries |
| `Program/` | Larger Python programs, more structured efforts |
| `Project/` | Full-scale mini-projects or assignments |
| `Temp/` | Temporary files, drafts, experiments, work in progress |

If you plan to add more, you might also consider folders for tests, utilities, etc.

## Getting Started

To set up this repository locally:

1. Clone the repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IshanGupta-Code/Python.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project folder:  
   ```bash
   cd Python
   ```

3. (Optional) Create & activate a virtual environment:  
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/macOS
   venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
   ```

4. Install any dependencies (if there are `requirements.txt` files or similar). Example:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

- Explore the folders based on your level: start with `Basics` if you're new, then move to `Libraries` and `Project`.  
- For each module, there may be sample code / assignments. Run Python scripts via the command line, or import modules as needed.  
- If the code connects to a database, ensure the database is set up and credentials/configs are updated accordingly.
